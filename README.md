# Code Samples

A helpful set of resources to start a project.

I have the following sets available:

1. **Simple Node Server / Client**, this is a basic NodeJS server that can handle GET and POST requests. It also comes with a client that communicates with the server via jQuery.

2. **Angular UI**, a simple example of how we can use the Angular UI library.

3. **Angular Material Design**, an example of Material Design with some Angular features.

4. **Angular2 Bootstrap**, a combination of Angular2 and Bootstrap. This is an old version of Angular2 so maybe it won't work in the future.
